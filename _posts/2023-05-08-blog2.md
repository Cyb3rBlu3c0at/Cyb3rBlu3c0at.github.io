![](../assets/images/blog2/LEcmd.jpg)

The command will reach out to *https[:]//newk1[.]shop/LzDBxdjP/newvice[.]hta*. As part of the script, it will write all text of newvice[.]hta to the file path *C[:]\Users\$env:APPDATA\Roaming\newvice[.]hta*. The last two operations will execute the file *newvice[.]hta* and then delete it after sleeping for 3 seconds.
