I have most recently obtained the Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator (CHFI) and have also completed the CompTia Security+, CySA+, Magnet Certified Forensic Examiner and eLearn Security Certified Malware Analysis Professional. Future certifications I would like to pursue is the GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst (GCFA) and GIAC Reverse Engineering Malware (GREM).

I am very passionate about computers and have been since I was a kid. I was looking to follow my passion and successfully changed careers into a Cyber Security role.

I credit my father for my early interest in computers. We would build computers together from barebones to fully operational. He taught me how to navigate the DOS command line to find what I was looking for. He taught me how to install a home network and how to troubleshoot common issues.

As I got older, I chose to join the US Army Airborne Rangers and jumped out of perfectly good airplanes; but now I prefer to keep my feet on the ground.

After the military, I went to college for Criminal Justice and obtained an Associate Degree and immediately joined the Eastern Missouri Police Academy. After completing the academy I was offered a job with the Bellefontaine Neighbors Police Department.

It was in September of 2016 that I was choosen to become a Detective. In the same month, I also became the department's Certified Digital Forensic Investigator. As I did more with digital forensics I realized how much I missed working with computers.

I believe my path in life has come full circle and it has ignited my desire to follow a new path towards cyber security.
